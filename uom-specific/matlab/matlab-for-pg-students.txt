Hi, 

As a postgraduate student, you can use MATLAB on University-owned equipment.

If your PC is a managed desktop and MATLAB is not currently installed, you can install it from the Software Centre http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/software/. Should there be any difficulties with this process, the Support Centre can remotely deploy the software to your computer.

If your PC is a non-managed desktop, the Support Centre can remotely access your machine and install the software for you, or arrange for a member of field support to install the software for you.

For laboratory computers, your supervisor will have to request this via the Support Centre.

Postgraduate students are not licenced to install MATLAB on personally-owned equipment. Alternatives to consider for this purpose include: Octave (open-source software which is source-code compatible with MATLAB https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), Mathematica, Maple (both licenced for use by UoM PG students).

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Thanks
Gerard
