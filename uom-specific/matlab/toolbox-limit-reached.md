# MATLAB toolboxes at UoM
An overview of the available MATLAB toolboxes is given at
https://www.applications.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/show_content.php?id=178.

# MATLAB licence seats at UoM
The network licence has around 600 seats for MATLAB, but generally far fewer for toolboxes.
This is usually sufficient but sometimes all the licence seats are simultaneously in use.
At this point you will get an error message such as the one below:

> License Manager Error -4
> Number of users for Optimization toolbox reached

In this situation you should wait a while then try again.

If you regularly use a toolbox and find that you are having to wait to get access,
consider purchasing a toolbox licence for your exclusive use.
Please contact Research IT application support to arrange this.
