# MATLAB toolboxes at UoM
An overview of MATLAB toolboxes is given at https://www.applications.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/show_content.php?id=178.

The research version of MATLAB at UoM comes with 12 MATLAB toolboxes, and the NAG toolbox.
The list of toolboxes is detailed here:

If you need access to a toolbox that is not in that list, you will need to purchase a license for it. 

# Purchase of a toolbox for exclusive use
- IT services request a quote from the MathWorks
- The user pays MathWorks directly for the quoted toolbox.
- The toolbox will be associated with the network (Research) licence, 1560.
- Licence file is updated - lead time of a few days.
- Field support / Support Centre will install the toolbox on the required machine(s).
- The licence token is for your exclusive use, but belongs to the University of Manchester.
- As such, you wouldn't be able to take the toolbox with you if you leave UoM.

# Annual maintenance fee
- In general, purchase of a toolbox would give you the current version only.
- Updates to the toolbox i.e. to enable compatibility with subsequent versions of MATLAB require a `maintenance` fee to be paid (this is small compared with the initial purchase cost).
- For ease of support, IT services have made a policy decision that the maintenance fee has to be paid for a user to retain access to the toolbox.
- You get a reminder each year to pay the maintenance cost, which is what most users do. However, there is no obligation to pay the maintenance if you no longer need the toolbox.
